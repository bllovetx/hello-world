# hello-world
This my hello-world repository!

## My major
I'm now studying both Physics and CS at Kuang Yaming Honors School in Nanjing University.
The reason for two major is that I'm really looking forward to see what will happen when Phy meets CS, and I'm also interested in the field of Quantum Computation.

## Recent work
For CS, we are now studying Abstract Algebra and working on a project called NEMU, in which we are writing a x86 emulator on linux.
